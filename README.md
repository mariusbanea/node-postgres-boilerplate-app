# Node and PostgreSQL Boilerplate app
## How to set it up
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install the dependencies for the project:
    ```console
    npm install
    ```
3. If there are high vulnerabilities reported during the install:
    ```console
    npm audit fix --force
    ```
4a. Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running on a Mac:
    ```console
    pg_ctl restart
    ```
4b. Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running on a Windows (example bellow is for PostgreSQL 13):
    ```console
    pg_ctl.exe restart -D  "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13\data"
    ```
5. Create a User for this project:
    ```console
    createuser testuser
    ```
6. Create a database for the project with your user as the owner:
    ```console
    createdb testdb
    ```
7. Grant all privileges for the new database
    ```console
    psql testdb
    ```
    ```sql
    alter user testuser with encrypted password 'qwerty';
    grant all privileges on database testdb to testuser;
    ```
8. Rename the `example.env` file to `.env` and update the following fields with your database credentials:
    ```console
    MIGRATION_DB_NAME=
    MIGRATION_DB_USER=
    MIGRATION_DB_PASS=
    DB_URL="postgresql://USERNAME@localhost/DATABASE_NAME"
    ```
9. Create the database tables:
    ```console
    npm run migrate -- 1
    ```
10. Start the tests:
    ```console
    npm t
    ```
11. You should see output from 10 integration tests, all passing.



## Local Node scripts
* To install the node project ===> npm install
* To fix vulnerabilities after installation ===> npm audit fix --force
* To migrate the database ===> npm run migrate -- 1
* To run Node server (on port 8000) ===> npm run dev
* To run tests ===> npm run test
